Parametric OpenSCAD keyboard design

Inspired by MattDB's redox keyboard design on [thingiverse.com](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2704567) which is in turn inspired by the [Ergodox keyboard design] (https://deskthority.net/wiki/ErgoDox).

I wanted to add some changes to the redox keyboard, but can't make a 3D design if my life depended on it, so I decided to build a parametric design in [OpenSCAD] (http://www.openscad.org/) because I _can_ program.

First aim is to copy MattDB's design in parametric form.
